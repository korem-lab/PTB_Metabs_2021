# Instructions for running code:

To install required dependencies run the following command:
"conda env create -f ptb_metabs.yml"

To reproduce the analyses and panels run the following commands:
"python generate_figures.py"
"python generate_prediction_figures.py"

Note - in order to avoid having to regenerate the null distributions of p-values required for the msea (extended data figure 5d) you will need to unzip the zipped p-value files contained within data/msea
